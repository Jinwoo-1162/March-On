                <br>That means your account on March On holds NO private information whatsoever. <br>All we will ever ask from you is a username, 
                password, and a captcha.<br>To start a movement, go to the START tab. To find a movement, go to the FIND tab.<br></p></div>

                        <div class="backstory" style="margin: 0px 60px 0px 90px;"><p>March On arose from a frustration one of our creators, JP, felt during a walkout
                            protest in high school. Just a few weeks after the horrific shootings in 2018 at the Stoneman Douglas
                            High School in Parkland, Florida, JP's classmates had hastily organized a gun control walkout.
                            However, with no common place to organize, the walkout ended as a failure, as conflicting platforms,
                            egotistical speeches, and physical clashes seemed to draw the focus away from the issue at hand and towards 
                            the general state of disarray and confusion. JP and JZ created March On together in hopes that a decentralized, 
                            anonymous site for political youth could offer a safer and better way to stand 
                            up for one's deepest beliefs and opinions.<br></p></div>

                        <div class="backstory" style="margin: 0px 90px 0px 60px;"><p>Anyone that genuinely has something to say! 
                            After absolute privacy, March On's most defining feature is that despite being a site dedicated to hosting 
                            political opinions, March On has no officially designated political leaning. We believe that a huge part 
                            of offering a platform to speak up on is that that exact platform needs to be equal towards anyone. Now, with 
                            that being said, we do moderate troll accounts and bots on the site, but if you believe that your movement has been 
                            unjustly targeted and removed by our moderators, feel free to reach us at our contacts page. But for now, please 
                            sign in and start discovering how you can make a difference in the world today!
